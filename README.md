# Algorithms-A-i-i

Implementation of O(nlgn) algorithm for A[i]=i

Language Used - C

Given a sorted list of distinct integers A[1], A[2],...,A[n], you want to find out whether there is an index i for which A[i] = i. Give an algorithm that runs in time O(log n).  
 
For example, A = [-1, -2, 3, 5, 6, 7] does have such an index, i.e., A[3] = 3. But A =[0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7] doesnâ€™t have such an index.
